- **Style**: Simple spinner with transparent overlay  
- **Purpose**: Non-intrusive loading indicator during app usage

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits

1. **Professional First Impression**: Beautiful progress bar for initial loading
2. **Non-Intrusive Internal Loading**: Simple spinner doesn't distract from workflow
3. **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight animations
4. **User Experience**: Clear distinction between app loading vs internal operations

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Initial App Loading
The enhanced progress bar appears automatically when:
- User first opens the application
- Shows during Aurelia framework initialization
- Displays beautiful gradient background with animated progress
- Automatically transitions to main application

### Internal App Operations  
The standard loading modal appears during:
- HTTP requests to APIs
- Data loading operations
- Any internal processing
- Shows simple spinner with transparent overlay

### Code Usage
No additional code needed - both loading systems work automatically:

```javascript
// HTTP requests automatically trigger the standard loading modal
this.httpClient.fetch('/api/data')
  .then(response => {
    // Loading modal disappears automatically
  });
```
